# SQL Analytics & Data Engineering Foundations

This repository represents a **hands-on SQL and data engineering–oriented project**, focused on analyzing sales data using a relational database. It demonstrates practical experience with **SQL analytics, data modeling concepts, and business-driven metrics**, built through self-directed learning and personal projects.

Rather than isolated exercises, the queries and structure in this repository reflect a **domain-based approach**, similar to how data is organized and queried in real-world analytics and data engineering contexts.

---

## Project Goals

* Build a solid foundation in **SQL for analytics and data engineering**
* Practice querying **relational data models** using realistic business scenarios
* Design and calculate **core sales and revenue metrics**
* Organize SQL logic by **data domain and analytical purpose**

---

## Repository Structure

The project is organized by domain to reflect real analytics and data workflows:

* **analytics/**
  Analytical queries focused on business metrics and insights

  * Revenue analysis
  * Sales metrics

* **database-project/**
  Queries and logic related to database structure and metric definitions

* **scripts/**
  Foundational SQL scripts and early practice queries

This structure mirrors how SQL code is often organized in analytics and data teams, separating **core metrics**, **business logic**, and **foundational queries**.

---

## Implemented Metrics

The repository includes queries that calculate and analyze key business metrics, such as:

* **Average Order Value (AOV)**
  Calculated using order-level aggregation to reflect real business definitions

* **Revenue by Month**
  Time-based aggregation to analyze sales trends

* **Revenue by Category**
  Multi-table joins to evaluate category performance

* **Revenue by Author**
  Revenue attribution across related entities

All metrics are derived from relational joins across orders, order items, products, authors, and categories, reinforcing a **data modeling and analytical mindset**.

---

## Skills Demonstrated

* SQL (advanced SELECTs, JOINs, aggregations)
* Relational database thinking
* Metric definition and business logic
* Data organization by domain
* Query readability and maintainability
* Analytical reasoning applied to structured data

---

## Tools & Technologies

* SQL
* MySQL
* Relational Databases

---

## Ongoing Development

This repository is **actively evolving**. New metrics, refinements, and structural improvements are continuously added as my understanding of **data engineering and analytics concepts** deepens.

The goal is to progressively move from analytics-focused SQL toward more advanced **data engineering patterns**, while maintaining clear, well-documented logic.

## Notes

This project is part of my professional preparation for an **entry-level role in Data Engineering or Data Analytics**, leveraging a Software Engineering background with a strong focus on data and databases.
